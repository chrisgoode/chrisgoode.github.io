I originally published this video over at drchrisgoode, but I wanted makers to see it here. This is a replica of the amplifier that John Deacon made and Brian May played through on some Queen albums. It runs on a 9V battery (the British ones, not the ones you can get in the US), and it's amazing. These guys have inspired me my whole life as a musician and as a maker!
