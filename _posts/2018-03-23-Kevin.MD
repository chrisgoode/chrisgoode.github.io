Later this year (2018) I'll be posting a tutorial on how to make an electric guitar using Fusion 360 and a CNC milling machine. The first step in all of this is to complete the excellent tutorial by [EvanandKatelyn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuMYw2l2UeWyTGYixYfRCA) found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqnvzxuXFTQ).

Here's some footage of our CNC putting the finishing touches on Kevin.
