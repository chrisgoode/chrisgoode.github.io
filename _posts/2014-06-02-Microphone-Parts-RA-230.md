title: RA-23 Microphone Build

Here's an oldie but a goode (heh, it's actually pronounced Good). I built a microphone from [Microphone-parts.com](https://microphone-parts.com) and made a video of the build. I still use this mic and it sounds wonderful on vocals, acoustic guitar, overhead, etc. I highly recommend this kit and the great people over there.
