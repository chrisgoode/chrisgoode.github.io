title: How to Make an Electric Guitar using Fusion 360 and CNC - Step 3
---
Greetings all. Step 3 is pretty long, I'm not going to lie to you. But it's useful if you are interested in actually carving out the guitar (or whatever) you designed in Fusion 360. Here's where we start to talk about toolpaths, tools, and milling your design. Exporting to gcode formatted for your CNC is handled in a later video, but join me as we jump into the Manufacture workspace as they're calling it now...{% include video id="_vy3IoFXk5c" provider="youtube" %}
