title: How to Make an Electric Guitar using Fusion 360 and CNC - Step 5
---
Here we finally leave our guitar body behind and start tackling the neck. This first part covers the fretboard. The thing of interest to non-luthiers here is that it's the first model in this series that has a curve into the z dimension - so this is a model that might be difficult to cut from 2D CAD programs like V-Carve or perhaps Easel. By the way, if anybody has any tips as to how I could improve my Fusion 360 skills, please reach out! I'm a total amateur with no formal training in CAD/CAM and just jumped right into guitar making - I am probably making a bunch of rookie mistakes...{% include video id="isiBCyySwvM" provider="youtube" %}
