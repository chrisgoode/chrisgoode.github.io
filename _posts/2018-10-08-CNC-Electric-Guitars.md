title: CNC Electric Guitars (and basses!)
---
I've spent the better part of the past year learning how to design and make electric guitars and basses using Autodesk's Fusion 360 and the CNC milling machine at my makerspace [Decatur Makers](https://decaturmakers.org). I'm no expert by any means, but there's a great deal of interest in this method for making guitars. Making guitars is also a great demonstration of various CNC techniques such as 3d tool paths, flip milling, etc.

Watch this site and I'll take you step-by-step through my workflow, linking to videos on my YouTube. Again, I'm not an expert, so please let me know if you see ways I can do things better in Fusion 360, or on the CNC.

Here's one of the first guitar bodies I cut out on the CNC, for a 1972 Telecaster Deluxe-style guitar.
