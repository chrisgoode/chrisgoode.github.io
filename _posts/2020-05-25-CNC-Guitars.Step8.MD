Finally we get to the tough part - transitioning from the neck to the headstock. I've struggled a lot with this in the past, mainly because I wasn't paying close enough attention to my rails. Do yourself a favor: just make a new sketch dedicated to the rails and make sure they are actually touching all profiles through which you are trying to loft! This transition is handled wonderfully by Brad Anderson Jr., another Decatur Maker, to whom I link in the video. I do things only slightly differently than he does.
