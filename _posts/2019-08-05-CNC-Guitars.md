title: How to Make an Electric Guitar using Fusion 360 and CNC - Step 0
---
I finally started documenting my process for designing electric guitars in Fusion 360, and building them on [Decatur Makers'] (https://decaturmakers.com) CNC milling machine. I'm sure that experienced CAD/CAM people will find many errors in my methods, so please let me know in the comments (on YouTube) how I might improve things! This video covers Step Zero, whereby I import a pdf plan for a guitar into Fusion 360. Enjoy!
