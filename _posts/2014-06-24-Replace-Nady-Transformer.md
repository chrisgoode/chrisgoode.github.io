title: Replace Nady DI Transformer
---
A lot of the videos I'm linking to from this site were originally published on my other YouTube channel, under [drchrisgoode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQoQqKXcQv_m8_KcRE6vprQ?view_as=subscriber). There are a lot of academic videos there, though.

I took an old Nady DI box (I play bass guitar) and replaced the transformer with a Jensen [JT-DB-E](http://www.jensen-transformers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jt-db-e.pdf) and the results were... ...transformative. Check it out:
